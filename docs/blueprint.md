## Style Guidelines:

- The chosen theme is dark. The primary color is a deep royal purple, Hex: #6F22BF, representing sophistication and a tech-forward mindset. It bridges the 'peacock' depth with a 'sunset' richness.
- The background color is a very dark, subtly desaturated purple, Hex: #1E1A22, providing a clean and professional canvas that supports the tech-modern aesthetic.
- The accent color is a vibrant sky blue, Hex: #B5ECFF, chosen to provide energetic contrast against the dark theme and highlight interactive elements, echoing the iridescent qualities of a peacock.
- Headlines will use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, techy, and professional feel. Body text will use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability and a neutral, objective aesthetic.
- Code snippets, if any, will be displayed using 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for clarity and industry standard formatting.
- A minimalist, geometric iconography style will be used throughout the site. The Discord icon will be replaced with a game controller to personalize the contact link, catering to User ID: 446476397813170186.
- The layout will be multi-page, featuring clear section headers to ensure quick scanning and easy navigation for employers. Each section will be logically organized to present information concisely.
- Subtle, smooth transition animations will be implemented for navigation between pages or sections, enhancing the modern user experience without distracting from content.
